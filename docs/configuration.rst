General
--------

`err-stackstorm` configuration is found in Errbot's `config.py` file.

.. note:: If you followed the Errbot setup documentation this file will have been created by downloading a template. If this file has not already been created, please create it following the `Errbot's instructions <http://errbot.io/en/latest/user_guide/setup.html#id1>`_.

Here's a sample err-stackstorm configuration:

.. code-block:: python

    STACKSTORM = {
        "auth_url": "https://your.stackstorm.com/auth/v1",
        "api_url": "https://your.stackstorm.com/api/v1",
        "stream_url": "https://your.stackstorm.com/stream/v1",
        "route_key": "errbot",
        "plugin_prefix": "st2",
        "verify_cert": True,
        "secrets_store": "cleartext",
        "session_ttl": 3600,
        "user_token_ttl": 86400,
        "api_auth": {
            "user": {
                "name": "my_username",
                "password": "my_password",
            },
            "token": "<User token>",
            "apikey": "<API Key>"
        },
        "rbac_auth": {
            "standalone": {},
        },
        "timer_update": 900, #  Unit: second.  Interval to check the user token is still valid.
    }

ST2 ChatOps Configuration
--------------------------

StackStorm's `ChatOps pack <https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/tree/master/contrib/chatops>`_ has to be installed and a notify rule file added to the pack.

The notify rule must be placed in ``/<st2>/packs/chatops/rules``. You can find the rule file necessary for `err-stackstorm` `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nzlosh/err-stackstorm/master/contrib/stackstorm-chatops/rules/notify_errbot.yaml>`_. Just copy-and-paste this file and save it as ``notify_errbot.yaml``.

Edit the ``/<st2>/packs/chatops/actions/post_message.yaml`` file and replace `chatops` with ``errbot``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  route:
    default: "errbot"

.. note:: See Route Key below for information on customising the route.

Authentication
---------------

`err-stackstorm` must have valid credentials to use StackStorm's API.
Stackstorm's authentication is possible with:

* Username and password
* User token
* API key

See `Stackstorm's Authentication docs <https://docs.stackstorm.com/authentication.html>`_ for more details on how to generate credentials.

Username/Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using a username and password will allow `err-stackstorm` to renew the user token once it expires.

.. note:: If you specify both username/password and a User Token, the User Token will be used and the *username/password will be ignored*.

User Token
^^^^^^^^^^

To avoid using the username/password pair in a configuration file, it's possible to supply a User Token as generated by StackStorm when a username/password is authenticated successfully.

If using an User Token `err-stackstorm` will no longer have access to the Stackstorm's API once it expires.

.. note:: When the token expires, a new one must be generated and updated in config.py which in turn requires Errbot to be restarted. This form of authentication is the least practical for production environments.

API Key
^^^^^^^^

*API Key support has been included since StackStorm v2.0.*

When an API Key is provided, all other authentication settings are ignored and the API Key is used.

If using an API Key, `err-stackstorm` will no longer have access to the Stackstorm's API once it expires.

.. note:: It is considered a mistake to supply a token or username/password pair when using the API Key.

Secrets Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The secrets store is used by `err-stackstorm` to cache StackStorm API credentials. The available backends are:

* cleartext


Cleartext
""""""""""

The cleartext store maintains the cache in memory and does not encrypt the contents to disk. It **does not** protect the stored secrets in memory.

Advanced Options
----------------

Route Key
^^^^^^^^^

The route key is used by err-stackstorm to inform StackStorm where to send result notifications for action-aliases.  StackStorm sends notification events via the stream interface that are marked with the route key.  Err-stackstorm filters these events using the route key and will handle any events that match its configured route key.

By altering the route key, it is possible to have multiple instances of err-stackstorm that are connected to the same StackStorm instance.  This would allow for configurations where StackStorm is available on multiple chat backends.

Example
"""""""
A StackStorm instance has 2 err-stackstorm instances.  The first err-stackstorm instance uses the `errbot-slack` route key while the second instance uses the `errbot-discord` route key.  Both instances have the same plugin prefix and expose the same action-aliases.  This would mean the command `!st2 pack list` could be run on discord and the result notification would be routed to the `errbot-discord` err-stackstorm instance.


Plugin Prefix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default the plugin prefix is set to `st2`.  The plugin prefix serves to prevent action-aliases collisions with errbot's native plugins commands.  It is possible to customise the plugin prefix to use a more appropriate naming scheme for the environment err-stackstorm is running.

Aside from cosmetic value, customising the plugin prefix can allow for multiple err-stackstorm instances to occupy the same chat channel.  This would be achieved by setting a unique plugin-prefix per instance.

.. note:: Always use strings that do not conflict with existing errbot commands.

Example
"""""""
In the case of multiple instances of a StackStorm and err-stackstorm pair, say 1 per data centre or 1 per region, it would be possible to assign a unique plugin prefix per instance.  Let's say there were 2 pairs with the plugin-prefix of `dc1` and `dc2`.  Both bots could occupy `#automation` channel and users could trigger the pack list action-alias in data centre #1 by calling `!dc1 pack list` or get available action-aliases from data centre #2 by calling `!dc2help`.

Session TTL
^^^^^^^^^^^

The session time to live is used to set the maximum lifetime an err-stackstorm sessoin is permitted to exist.  Once the session expires the user will need to re-authenticate before being able to execute action-alias commands.

User Token TTL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The user token ttl is used to set the maximum life time a StackStorm User Token will be permitted to exist.  Once the user token has expired the user will need to re-authenticate before being able to execute action-alias commnds.

Locale
-------

Errbot uses the system's locale for handling text. If you're getting unicode errors like this::

  UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xe9' in position 83: ordinal not in range(128)

Make sure the systems locale is configured for unicode encoding. In the example below, the machine has been set to English (en) New Zealand (NZ) with utf-8 encoding (.UTF8).

.. code-block:: bash

  # locale
  LANG=en_NZ.UTF8
  LANGUAGE=
  LC_CTYPE="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_NUMERIC="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_TIME="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_COLLATE="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_MONETARY="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_MESSAGES="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_PAPER="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_NAME="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_ADDRESS="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_TELEPHONE="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_MEASUREMENT="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_NZ.UTF8"
  LC_ALL=en_NZ.UTF8
